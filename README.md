## ‚ùì FAQ

- **Kyro feels slow or laggy!**
  - Clear your browser cache/cookies, ensure you are running in production mode, and check your system resources. Running on older hardware or with too many background processes may impact speed.

- **How do I change the panel's name?**
  - Set the `VITE_APP_NAME` variable in all `.env` files to your desired name. This will also rename all Kyro commands and require you to stop all running Kyro processes and rename your Kyro database accordingly.

- **Can I install a theme or plugins?**
  - Not at this time. Kyro does not currently support themes or plugins. To customize the look, you must manually edit the frontend files.

- **How do I set up email verification?**
  - Register a Resend account for an API key and link your domain to Resend. This enables email verification for user registration and password resets.

- **The application won't start. What should I check?**
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed with `bun install` in each repo (`KRYPTON`, `KYRO`, and `core`). Verify your `.env` files are present and correctly configured. Check the logs with `kyro logs` for specific errors.

- **How do I contribute to Kyro?**
  - Fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Ensure your code follows the existing style and includes tests where appropriate.

- **How do I update Kyro to the latest version?**
  - Pull the latest changes from the repository, reinstall dependencies with `bun install`, and run any new migrations with `kyro migrate --force`.

- **Where can I get help or report bugs?**
  - Open an issue on the GitHub repository or check the Discussions section for community support.
