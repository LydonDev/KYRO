Kyro is a personal project that I have been developing solo, originally forked from Argon. This project is intended as a learning platform for myself, contributors, and the wider community to explore and improve their skills.

Please note:

Kyro does not guarentee support for commercial, enterprise, or production use.
This is a passion project, developed in my spare time, and I do not receive any compensation for it.
If you encounter any issues, I welcome your feedback and will do my best to address them. However, please be mindful of my local time zone (GMT) and understand that responses may not be immediate.

Thank you for your interest and understanding!
